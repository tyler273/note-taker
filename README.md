# Note Taker

## Description

The goal of this project was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

I was able to complete the assignment through tutoring from my fellow peer [Myro Lee](https://github.com/myrojoylee)!
