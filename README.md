# Note Taker

## Description

The goal of this project was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Usage

After clicking the link below for the live site, the user will click the blue "Get Started!" button and be brought to the note taker interface where they can enter a title and body text below. After clicking the save icon on the top right of the webpage the new note will appear on the left hand side as a tab that can be clicked on. Notes can be repeatedly created in this manner and viewed by being clicked on from the left side column.
